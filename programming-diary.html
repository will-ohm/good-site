          <ul>
            <li>Achievements: Created first website, added picture and bio to Github profile, and linked Programming Diary to GitHub</li>
            <li>State of mind: feel accomplished after getting so much done, and encouraged because it was surprisingly fun!</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>Day 2 <time datetime="2025-06-01">[25-06-01]</time></h2> 
          <ul>
            <li>Summary: Resumed the project after a pause of 7 weeks</li> 
            <li>Reason for pause and restart: Primarily another, more urgent project that began at the same time. By now, I have established a good structure with that other project which leaves me time for other things. At the same time, I continue to be seriously interested in the possibility of pursuing a career in programming, and so I want to bring this project to a conclusion. </li>
            <li>Achievements: Revised file structure based on experience gathered using VS Code and Markdown over the last weeks. Revised plan with help from ChatGPT.</li>
            <li>State of mind: Still pleased with these very early results of the project and motivated to pick up where I left off.</li>
            <li>Goals: My new goal is to complete the project in 6 weeks [25-07-18], spending 1-2 hours on it per workday.</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>Day 3 <time datetime="2025-06-02">[25-06-02]</time></h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Achievements: finished the freeCodeCamp “Build a Cat Photo App” Workshop. Applied what I learned to the website: added sections, unordered lists, a figure and a caption, and a footer. Then I had ChatGPT check the code and made some additional changes: I added a CSS stylesheet and a favicon, and made some other small adjustments.</li>
            <li>State of mind: I'm finding that I am having fun making sense of the components of HTML and, even more so, applying what I learn to my own website project. There is something gratifyingly creative about this work.</li>
            <li>Goals: Tomorrow I will have a first try at CSS: I will integrate CSS into the website, including colours, fonts, and stylesheets.</li>
