        <h2>Day 7 <time datetime="2025-06-06">[25-06-04]</time></h2> 
          <ul>
            <li>Achievements: Implemented CSS variables Streamlined and polished the website's CSS and HTML. Introduced CSS variables to define and reuse values like colors and fonts, grouped them for clarity, and added a dark mode theme using @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark). Enhanced typography in the programming diary with font-style: italic and text-transform: uppercase. Improved layout and accessibility by adding margin-top to figcaption, styling footer links, and implementing :focus/:active states for keyboard navigation. Visually separated the footer with a border-top and background color. Added a top &lt;nav&gt; for better structure, tested mobile responsiveness, and removed pointer cursors from non-interactive hover effects. Finally, replaced the homepage image with one more aligned to the site’s aesthetic and values, and tidied up the code to remove minor redundancies.</li>
            <li>State of mind: Continue to find this work highly engaging and interesting. In particular, it seems to be boosting my motivation to get up in the morning. I had no trouble working on the project for three hours straight today — it felt focused and rewarding throughout.</li>
            <li>Next steps: The next step is a small assignment ChatGPT has prepared for me, where I need to design and create a landing page, using what I've learned so far. I have an idea and am eager to try it out.</li>

        <h2>Day 6 <time datetime="2025-06-04">[25-06-04]</time></h2> 
          <ul>
            <li>Achievements: Today I worked through the first 15 steps of the freeCodeCamp introductory tutorial on the CSS Box Model. I also put the code I wrote in the tutorial in my website's style.css and played around with it a little. Then I added link and hover effects and also adjusted the colours used on site accordingly.</li>
            <li>State of mind: Again, there were moments today studying with freeCodeCamp and working with ChatGPT where I felt quite out of my depth, but I also felt that my understanding was developing and that I was able to make sense of a great deal of the new material encountered today. I find the hover effects very appealing and am beginning to feel quite pleased about the look of the website.</li>
            <li>Next steps: Repetition and fine-tuning. Prepare assignment.</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>Day 5 <time datetime="2025-06-03">[25-06-03]</time></h2> 
          <ul>
            <li>Achievements: Tried out simple CSS-formatting. Changed background colour, section colours, fonts and font colours (including Google fonts), and modified margins and padding to improve layout. I also worked through about half of the freeCodeCamp introduction to CSS.</li>
            <li>State of mind: There is a lot I don't understand, but I am striking a balance between thoughtful inquiry that improves my understanding and becoming distracted and overwhelmed by going down too many rabbit holes. I am observing that I continue to find this work naturally and continuously engaging.</li>
            <li>Next steps: Learn about the CSS box model; add hover effects to site</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>Day 4 <time datetime="2025-06-02">[25-06-02]</time></h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Achievements: finished the freeCodeCamp “Build a Cat Photo App” Workshop. Applied what I learned to the website: added sections, unordered lists, a figure and a caption, and a footer. Then I had ChatGPT check the code and made some additional changes: I added a CSS stylesheet and a favicon, and made some other small adjustments.</li>
            <li>State of mind: I'm finding that I am having fun making sense of the components of HTML and, even more so, applying what I learn to my own website project. There is something gratifyingly creative about this work.</li>
            <li>Goals: Tomorrow I will have a first try at CSS: I will integrate CSS into the website, including colours, fonts, and stylesheets.</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>Day 3 <time datetime="2025-06-01">[25-06-01]</time></h2> 
          <ul>
            <li>Summary: Resumed the project after a pause of 7 weeks</li> 
            <li>Reason for pause and restart: Primarily another, more urgent project that began at the same time. By now, I have established a good structure with that other project which leaves me time for other things. At the same time, I continue to be seriously interested in the possibility of pursuing a career in programming, and so I want to bring this project to a conclusion. </li>
            <li>Achievements: Revised file structure based on experience gathered using VS Code and Markdown over the last weeks. Revised plan with help from ChatGPT.</li>
            <li>State of mind: Still pleased with these very early results of the project and motivated to pick up where I left off.</li>
            <li>Goals: My new goal is to complete the project in 6 weeks [25-07-18], spending 1-2 hours on it per workday.</li>

            <li>State of mind: feel accomplished after getting so much done, and encouraged because it was surprisingly fun!</li>
