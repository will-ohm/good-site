  <h1>Programming Diary</h1>
  <p>A record of my first programming efforts</p>
  <p>Day 1 [25-04-11]: Created my first website, added a picture and bio to my Github profile, and linked my Programming Diary to GitHub. So quite a bit, and it was surprisingly fun!</p>
  <p>Day 2 [25-05-31]: Project restart. Resumed the project after a pause of 7 weeks. Reason for Interrgitpation. Primarily another, more urgent project that began at the same time. By now, I have established a good structure with that other project which leaves me time for other projects. At the same time, I continue to be seriously interested in the possibility of pursuing a career in programming, and so I want to bring this project to a conclusion. Approach. Revised file structure based on experience gathered using VS Code and Markdown over the last weeks. Revised plan with help from ChatGPT. State of mind. Still pleased with these very early results of the project and motivated to pick up where I left off. Goals. My new goal is to complete the project in 6 weeks [25-07-18], spending 1-2 hours on it per workday.
